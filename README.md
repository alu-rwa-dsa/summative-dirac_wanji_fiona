## Data Structures and Algorithms used

 - Binary search - we’re using this to enable a search feature in our app for different users and questions later on with the finished app.
 - Quick sort - we’re using this to rank users according to their scores

## Project Description

Our project is a quiz application, similar to duolingo and quizlet in that user's answer questions on different topics. In our case, all our topics are career development related as it is a project inspired by our own career development experiences and journeys.

The application has these features: 
  -A sign up and login feature: this is for users to sign up and be able to have their progress and scores tracked
  -A database: this stores the user's scores and details
  -A ranking and sorting system: this is to help administrators (like career development personnel and interns) check different users progress and scores, in order to see how    well their doing and whether they need any help. They can also use this to determine what score corresponds to what career readiness stamp
  -A basic GUI for users to interact with when they answer questions, which displays the questions and gives their score for the particular quiz they are doing 

The application has different question sets, with different topics and content. As career development content is generally the same for different years, we decided to make all the types of content available for all students, so the questions and students are not divided into years.

This gives career development the freedom to assign different sections each semester for different years or assign all years the same content, whatever they feel would be the most beneficial for the students. This application would not replace career development content, but it would work together with the content, in order to make it as easy and understandable for students, as well as comprehensive and useful. In an article of the benefits of Duolingo, author Jules Kirchner said she ‘would recommend using Duolingo in combination with a teacher-led (language) course’, which is why we are making it clear that career development content would not be replaced, just  integrated.


## Motivation

Our motivation for this application was to make career development content easier to learn and understand. 

A lot of students complain about the amount of career development content and how hard it is to take in all of it. This application was our solution to that; we wanted to present the content in a way that made it easier for students to understand and take it in, especially because of the heavy workload students have from their coursework and other extracurricular activities.

Looking at applications like quizlet and duolingo, we see that they divide content into different, small sections and allow students to study the larger topic section by section. That is what we wanted our application to do for ALU students.
